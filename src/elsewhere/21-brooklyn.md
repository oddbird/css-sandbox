I spent a week in Brooklyn,
working with Fantasai and Jen Simmons
on a range of ideas and proposals
for the future of CSS.
Most of those notes are documented elsewhere,
but I wanted to collate here
what we covered in that time.

Some of our notes & proposals
are documented on the [CSSWG Wiki](https://wiki.csswg.org/ideas):

- [Margin Collapse Controls](https://wiki.csswg.org/ideas/margin-collapsing)
- [Timelines and Interpolation](https://wiki.csswg.org/ideas/timelines)
- [Column and Row Gaps and Rules](https://wiki.csswg.org/ideas/gutter-styling)
- [Logical (Flow-relative) Syntax](https://wiki.csswg.org/ideas/logical-syntax)

## Agenda

- ✅ Cascade-6 Scoping
- ✅ Interpolation between breakpoints
- ✅ Rethink scroll timeline
- ✅ Margin-trim
- ✅ Container size & style queries
- ✅ CSS nesting
- ✅ css-grid-3 triage
- ✅ css-text-4 triage
- ✅ css-values-4 triage
- ✅ Flexible container name/type syntax
- ➡️ File a proposal for `minmax-span()`
- ➡️ `vw` units causing overflow/scrollbars
- ➡️ File an issue about containment interaction with subgrid
- ➡️ Define nested scopes
- ➡️ Responsive Tables
- ➡️ Additive Cascade
- ➡️ Text-decoration triage

## Implementor notes

There are a few high-priority features
that we think need to be addressed:

- Box alignment in block context
- Font-variant longhand values
- Colors 4&5 functions & color-spaces
- Get youtube to embed aspect ratios?
- `inherit()` function (https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/2864)

## Proposals, issues, and specifications

### Flow-relative syntax

The goal is to make it possible
for authors to write CSS
with "logical" (flow-relative) values
as a first-class default option --
combined with or replacing
"physical" (<abbr title="Top Right Bottom Left">trbl</abbr>) values.
This would require a multi-year process.
