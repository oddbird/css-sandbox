The `switch()` function
([proposed by Brian Kardell](#resources))
would provide conditional logic in CSS values,
similar to the Sass `if()` function,
but with access to some essential client-side values for comparison.
The initial proposal resolves around `available-inline-size`,
but that could be extended down the road.

Switches work off the built-in "phases"
that a browser rendering-engine goes through.
Some properties (like `display`) need to resolve early,
while other properties (eg `color`)
are not resolved until later.
The switch function could make different queries available
on different properties,
based on their place in the rendering lifecycle.

## Background

The [@container block](../query/) approach
relies on [CSS Containment](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-contain/)
and external-queries
to avoid infinite loops.
That approach would require
[single-axis size containment](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1031)
for most use-cases.
Such 1D containment is still theoretical,
and Safari/webkit
[do not yet support 2D containment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/contain#browser_compatibility).

The `switch()` proposal avoids those issues by limiting
the queries that can be switched on different properties --
ensuring e.g. `available-inline-size` cannot be queried
until it has been resolved.
Those limits come from the internal architecture of browser engines,
and make it possible to implement `switch()`
without relying on other hypothetical CSS features.

This might require teaching authors
the essential phases of browser rendering,
for a better understanding of which
properties would support what queries.
But that is similar to teaching the values of `contain`
when using a container-based approach.

## Prototype

Igalia has already developed a working
[prototype in Chromium](https://www.youtube.com/embed/8QFST9MvjyA).

## Related conditional functions

There have been
[several proposals](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5009#issuecomment-626072319)
and a [draft spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-conditional-values-1/#if)
for inline conditional functions
in CSS.
Here are some highlightsâ€¦

### Nth-value

```css
/* nth-value(<index>; <value>; <value> [; <value>]*) */
.card {
  color: nth-value(var(--color-index, 1); maroon; tomato);
  gap: nth-value(var(--size-index, 1); 1em; 2em);
  flex-direction: nth-value(var(--size-index, 1); column; row);
}

/* change the value based on media/container sizes */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { html { --color-index: 2; } }
@container (min-width: 45em) { .card { --size-index: 2; } }
```

This can be used anywhere
to toggle between a number of different values
by changing the value of a custom property.
It doesn't provide any new features,
but useful syntax sugar
for quickly switching between inline values
based on existing conditionals.
Those values can all remain defined in a single place,
rather than being split across at-rules.

- conditions: `<integer>`
- consequents: `<any-value>`
- properties: any
- resolved: var-like (invalid at computed value time)

### Condition

## Syntax

The initial proposal suggests:

```css
.foo {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: switch(
    (available-inline-size > 1024px) 1fr 4fr 1fr;
    (available-inline-size > 400px) 2fr 1fr;
    (available-inline-size > 100px) 1fr;
    default 1fr;
   );
}
```

The implemented prototype is a bit different,
but seems like a temporary way to fit existing CSS syntax:

```css
.foo {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: switch(
    auto /
     (available-inline-size > 1000px) 1fr 2fr 1fr 2fr /
     (available-inline-size > 500px) auto 1fr /
   );
}
```

There is also a comment from
[Fantasai](https://gist.github.com/bkardell/e5d702b15c7bcf2de2d60b80b916e53c#gistcomment-3295085)
with a proposal to make the syntax more efficient.

```css
.foo {
  grid-template-columns: switch( available-inline-size ?
    (? > 1024px) 1fr 4fr 1fr;
    (? > 400px) 2fr 1fr;
    (? > 100px) 1fr;
    1fr;
  );
}
```

## Thoughts

The two main "responsive component" approaches
complement each other well --
because they come at the same question (and all the tradeoffs)
from opposite sides.
The main advantages of `switch()` show up
when you want to query the size of a grid-track
rather than the element generating that track.

The `switch()` function is also very flexible,
and could solve many other context-responsive styling issues --
like adjusting `<em>` styles based on the inherited `font-style`,
or toggling values based on a variable.
That seems promising on multiple fronts.

Any inline-conditional syntax is bound to take up space,
and add clutter to CSS.
I'm not sure that's avoidable,
but it would be good to try and make the syntax
as light-weight as reasonable.

That becomes more of an issue if this were the _only_ way
to write conditional CSS.
Many languages provide both inline & block conditionals,
for good reason --
there are cases for each --
and I think that might also be the way to go in CSS.

## Questions

### Can we improve the balance of readability/efficiency?

This question seems intertwined
with a few other active discussions
about more generic block & inline conditionals.
Several of them are linked from
this proposal by Lea Verou:

[Higher level custom properties that control multiple declarations][5624]

[5624]: https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5624

### What observations can we support, on what properties?

The primary focus is on `available-inline-size`
used in grid-templates,
with mention of future ideas like `inherited-font-style`.
I'd love to flesh out that thinking a bit more.

Even if `available-inline-size` is enough for Level 1,
we need to define where and how it can be used.

### Can a single switch contain multiple observations?

The existing proposals & demos show
`available-inline-size` as the only value being observed.
If more observations are allowed,
will the syntax support combining/mixing observations
within a single switch function?
