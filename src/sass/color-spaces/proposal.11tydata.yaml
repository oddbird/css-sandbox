      - Finalize color interpolation logic, and `color.mix()` function
      - Note potential issues with missing (`none`) channels in conversion
      - Deprecate individual channel inspection functions in favor of
        `color.channel()`
      - Organize global and color-module function groups
      - Complete specification of global `hwb()` function,
        and deprecate `color.hwb()` functions
      - Specify updates to global `rgb()` functions

      - Organize and document open issues
      - Define `hsl()`/`hsla()` functions
      - Remove any out-of-gamut channel clamping and adjustments
      - Ensure channels are returned as-specified when inspecting

      - Define color spaces and channels more clearly,
        and update to reflect latest spec.
      - Define 'channel normalization' in a reusable procedure,
        and include is as part of the color component parsing procedure.
      - Use channel normalization to simplify color function overloads.
      - Define logic for `color.adjust()` and `color.scale()`, treating
        the `none` keyword as a value of `0`.

      This is a complete first draft of the color proposal, including all the
      proposed new & modified functions. However, there are still some
      questions to resolve in the editing & review process.

      - Draft logic for `color.complement()`, `color.invert()`, and
        `color.ie-hex-string()`.
      - Update logic for `color.mix()` and color interpolation to better
        match standards in CSS Colors 4 and 5.
