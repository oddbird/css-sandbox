In addition to our work on CSS specifications,
we're also working on new feature proposals and specs
for the [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) preprocessor.

The priorities right now are:

- Tools for managing new color syntax and multiple color-spaces
- Try/catch syntax, for error handling
- First-class css function calls
- Expanding internal utilities (lists & strings etc)
- URL handling & package management

From a broader perspective,
we believe that Sass can be a foundational tool
for the future of design systems tooling --
and there are many more features to consider along those lines.
For example: importing & exporting JSON data,
such as [design token files][].
