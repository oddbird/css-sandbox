This is where
[Miriam Suzanne](https://oddbird.net/authors/miriam/)
and [OddBird](https://oddbird.net/)
take notes
related to the
[CSS Working Group](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/),
the [Sass language](https://sass-lang.com/),
and related web platform features.
Everything here is un-official and incomplete --
because we prefer working in public.
