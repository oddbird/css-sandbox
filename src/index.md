This is a sandbox for
[Miriam Suzanne](https://oddbird.net/authors/miriam/)
and [OddBird](https://oddbird.net/)
to document our notes
related to
[CSS Working Group](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/),
[Sass language](https://sass-lang.com/),
and related web platform features.
Everything here is un-official and incomplete,
as we do our thinking in public.
