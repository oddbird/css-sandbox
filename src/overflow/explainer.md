## Introduction

Managing layout and design on the web
requires careful control of 'overflow' --
allowing content to be hidden
when it's not needed,
but accessibly discovered and revealed
when necessary.

There are many overlapping
user-interface design patterns
that can be used --
from standard continuous scrolling,
to scroll-snapping,
slideshows, carousels,
accordions, tabs,
and various hybrid approaches.
The lines between these patterns
are often somewhat blurry:

- CSS currently supports several overflow values,
  but the only built-in overflow-access interface
  is the continuous scrolling container.
  That can be extended with features
  such as scroll-animation,
  scroll-behavior, scroll-snapping,
  and so on.
- At the other end of a spectrum,
  most tab and accordion patterns
  are highly structured & sectioned overflow.
  Each section has an interactive label
  that can be used to show or hide
  the section contents (often one-at-a-time).
- In-between those two extremes,
  there are a wide range of patterns
  that get referred to as 'carousels'.
  These are not limited to the (problematic)
  infinite-auto-advancing home-page widgets,
  but range from video-streaming
  media selection,
  to slide shows,
  and e-commerce product-image viewers.

There have been many attempts
over the years
to define new tab or carousel components --
but they are often held up by:

- The complexity of
  use-case mixing and matching
  patterns from scrollers, carousels,
  tabs, and accordions
- The need to work around many
  underlying features
  that are missing from the web platform
- The fact that 'overflow'
  is a presentational concern
  tightly coupled with device/media/size conditions
  (and therefor part of CSS),
  but also requires interactive controls
  generally left to HTML components or JavaScript.

## Goals

The goal of this explainer
is not to propose yet another component,
or provide a one-size-fits-all solution
for all overflowing UI --
but to consider some baseline improvements to CSS overflow
that could help authors
flesh out the details of each pattern more elegantly,
consistently, and accessibly.
This could also help form the scaffolding
for future components, as needed.

In some cases,
we're able to propose a path forward --
and in other cases,
we simply document the problem
and some of the tradeoffs
with different approaches.

### Overlapping patterns

The patterns we're looking at
fall along a continuum
of scrolled and paged overflow:

- On one end,
  media-scroller carousels
  (like the Netflix video selection interface)
  are similar to horizontal overflow
  with scroll-snapping,
  and the occasional use of 'next/previous' navigation
  that is sometimes linked to items
  and sometimes to 'pages' of overflow.
- Slide-show style carousels
  often add small 'scroll-markers' (like dots)
  that represent either
  the individual items listed,
  or the viewable pages
  (if multiple items appear at once).
- Product-image carousels will often
  replace the dots with thumbnail image scroll-markers,
  and only show one item per 'page'.
  In this case general mouse scrolling
  (and visible scroll-bars)
  are often removed in favor of tab controls,
  while sometimes leaving gesture-based scrolling intact.
- Tabs are similar,
  but may often removing scroll-controls entirely.

Rather than thinking of these
as distinct patterns,
we want to understand the underlying set of controls
that are combined to create
any given variation.
Primarily: paged overflow
and interactive scroll markers
in a variety of forms.

### Overflow changes based on context

While HTML, CSS, and JS
often have distinct and separate 'concerns' --
semantics, presentation, and interaction --
overflow falls into a middle ground
that can be hard to break apart.
Content that overflows on one device,
or at a particular screen size,
may not need to overflow in other situations.
That's a presentational concern,
rather than a semantic one,
and often needs to be handled using media queries.

However,
semantics do play a clear role in
what patterns make sense
(the difference between a carousel and tabs
often comes down to how content is sectioned),
and different types of 'overflow' require
different interactions.
Any solutions provided here
have to account for changes in overflow
based on device/media/container context --
and help authors access the proper interactions
and accessible roles
for each type of overflow.

## Non-goals

### Application-Level Tabs

The 'tabs' interface pattern
has two common
and somewhat distinct use-cases:

1. Managing display of sectioned content
   within a single document
2. Managing display of multiple documents
   within an application

The former can be seen
as a form of 'content overflow'
covered by by this proposal.
When searching within a document,
users would expect content in hidden sections
to be 'discoverable'.
On the other hand,
application level tabs
(such as in a browser or text-editor)
represent distinct documents
rather than 'overflow'.
Users would not expect a search in one document
to reveal content in another tab.

This proposal is specific to
handling content overflow presentation in HTML and CSS,
rather than providing a generic solution
to the 'tabs' interface design pattern.

### Auto-advancing & Cyclic Home Page Carousels

The term 'carousel'
has a strong negative connotation
in web design circles,
thanks to the poor user-experience
of home page carousels
used to display an endless cycle of
'featured' content.

Readers rarely interact with this pattern,
and generally don't see content
beyond the first page of the carousel,
unless forced by auto-advancement,
which causes a whole new list
of accessibility and usability issues.

While that makes us hesitant
to use the term 'carousel' here,
there are a range of much more essential use-cases
that fall under the term --
and it's helpful to understand
the somewhat fluid and overlapping nature of
scroll/carousel/tab/accordion patterns.

### Virtual lists

Virtual lists are tightly related to overflow,
but outside the scope of this document.

## Possible solutions

Rather than proposing a single
complete solution to these fluid ux patterns,
we think it would be useful to address
the core HTML/CSS
layout and overflow issues
that make such an element difficult to implement.
This should provide a stepping-stone
for both authors and browser vendors
to explore and develop more narrowly defined
web-components or HTML elements
where they make sense.

There has already been
some significant progress
along these lines.
The `scroll-snap` properties,
scroll-linked animations,
and size container queries
all help authors better address overflow.
Below, we'll explore some of the features
that are still missing or difficult
for authors to get right.

### Carousel example

![Carousel boxes](../carousel-boxes.svg)

As a strawman example,
a developer should be able to use the following HTML
to create the visualized carousel:

```html
<carousel>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</carousel>
```

The visualized carousel
can be constructed
with the following style
dynamically generating all of the required components:

```css
carousel {
  display: grid;
  grid-template: 
    'previous scroller next' 1fr
    '. markers .' auto
    / auto 1fr auto;

  > li {
    /* Flow into scroller grid-flow defined below */
    grid-flow: --scroller;
  }

  &::grid-flow(--scroller) {
    grid-area: scroller;
    /* Paginate overflow? */
    overflow: paginate;
    scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;

    &::page {
      /* style all pages */
      scroll-snap-align: center;

      &:not(:active) {
        interactivity: inert;
        opacity: .5;
      }

      /* Create markers for each page */
      ::marker {
        /* Flow them into the markers grid-flow */
        grid-flow: --markers;
      }
    }
  }

  &::grid-flow(--markers) {
    grid-area: markers;
  }

  &::next {
    grid-area: next;
  }

  &::previous {
    grid-area: previous;
  }
}
```

### Paged overflow, in the browser

Simple carousels (or 'media-scrollers')
are often built with scrollable overflow
and scroll-snap targets.
What makes it a 'carousel' is the addition
of 'paged' navigation options:

- next/previous page arrows
- page markers (often dots)
  to show the number of pages
  and current active position

Paged overflow isn't a new idea in CSS.
While implementations have not always been
complete or consistent,
paged overflow is already well-defined for print,
and has a number of
[other use-cases](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2020/04/07/making-things-better/)
if it were available in the browser.

Establishing paged overflow on an element
would generate `::page` pseudo-element
[fragmentainers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Fragmentainer)
for descendant elements & content to flow through.

- pages are created as-needed
  based on the amount of content,
  and the size available to each page.
- by default, a page could be the size
  of the containing box (not including overflow),
  so that scrolling the view 100%
  would bring a new 'page' fully into view.
- Pages could be resized,
  which would impact how much content
  fits in a given page,
  how many pages are visible without scrolling,
  and how many pages are needed
  for the flow of content.
- Individual pages could be targeted
  using a syntax similar to `nth-child`

It's not immediately clear
what syntax would be best
for invoking this sort of paged overflow.
While this behavior is related to both `overflow`
and (in some ways) `display`,
neither property seems like a particularly good fit.

Paged use-cases (e.g. carousels)
might involve scrolling between pages,
while others (e.g. multicol wrapping) may not.
So pagination is not necessarily alternative to scrolled overflow.
Even if paged overflow had an `auto`-like scroll behavior,
to allow scrolling and non-scrolling pages,
single-axis paged overflow(`-x`/`-y`) doesn't make much sense.

Authors will also need a mechanism
for handling the layout of
elements within pages
(and the layout of the pages themselves) --
both of which require display values.
It's possible the pagination and layout controls
could be combined in a single property
(e.g. `display: paged grid`)
if it makes sense for them to cascade together.
Since display is a shorthand for
inside and outside values,
pagination would either need to be added
to one of those properties
or a third new display sub-property.

### Styling paged overflow

As mentioned above,
authors will need a way to provide
`display` values for both

1. the layout of `::page` elements themselves
2. the layout of child contents
  flowing through those pages

I would expect the overflowing/paginated parent element
to handle the layout of pages,
in which case
a new (`::page-contents`?) could be used
for the layout of content flowing through pages
(or vice versa).
An additional wrapping pseudo-element
like this might only support a limited subset of
CSS properties or pseudo-classes.

In some cases,
an author would style all `::page` elements,
but it would often be useful
to target specific pages
with e.g. `::page:nth-child(even)`
(or `::page(even)`).
However,
there might be recursion issues
with other combinations,
such as `::page:nth-last-child(even)`
or `::page:focus-within`,
if the styles applied
could change the number of pages
or placement of content in those pages.

{% note %}
Could these pseudo-classes be used for paged
(e.g. print) media as well?
{% endnote %}

### Page navigation / pagination

One of the design patterns
often associated with a 'carousel' component
is the use of 'dots' for
page-based navigation.
Rather than (or in addition to)
a continuous scrollbar,
readers can select the page
they want to move to.
These 'scroll markers' or 'pagination markers'
are much like list markers --
often taking the form of dots/bullets,
but occasionally styled as counters,
or even thumbnails and other content.

Sometimes those page-access markers
represent individual items in a list.
This per-item marking
has a large overlap with 'tabs' --
a line that blurs in
'product-image' carousels for example.
Where's the line between
a carousel-marker with an image thumbnail,
and a section tab with a text label?

In general,
item-based markers
can be provided by authors in the markup,
along with the items they mark.
In that case,
the main concerns are:

- Keeping the markers
  inline with the items they mark,
  vs creating a distinct table-of-contents
  before/after the flow of items/pages
- Managing the link between markers
  and the content they mark
- Maintaining the current state
  of active content and markers

We'll explore
some of those issues more below.

However, many scroll markers represent
the abstract 'pages' generated by
a flow of content --
where the number of markers may change
based on the size of a container --
or arbitrary scroll-snap points
that combine items and pages.
In those situations,
a marker would need to be generated
either using JavaScript,
or (ideally) by the browser.

Una Kravets and Adam Argyle
have explored this in an early draft
[`::scroll-marker` explainer](https://github.com/argyleink/ScrollSnapExplainers/tree/main/css-scroll-marker).
In their proposal,
markers can be generated
by setting a `scroll-display` property
to one of `bar` (the default),
`auto`, or `marker`
on the scrolling parent.
This leaves a number of interesting questions
open for consideration:

- Would we need a way to request markers generated
  per-item, per-page, or per-snap-target?
  Can those options be combined?
- Can the `scroll-display`
  can be set differently for inline/block axis?
- Can values be combined to show both
  a continuous-scroll bar and also scroll markers?
- Do previous/next arrows fall into a similar category?
  While they are simpler for authors to provide in-markup,
  they require a fair amount of state-management
  to get right.

#### Interactive, state-managing, generated content?

One of the most difficult aspects
in building web carousels, slideshows, and tabs
is proper 'wiring' for the interactive navigation
(dots, tabs, prev/next) --
with proper accessibility and keyboard interaction,
along with scroll-position and active-state management.
This is especially true
when the 'targets' of that navigation
are based on fluid overflow
rather than specific DOM elements.

This is the primary reason
that authors would prefer a
built-in web platform solution,
but it also raises big questions
about using 'generated content'
for interactive controls.

The generated markers
would also need to track and expose
the current active state -
providing a way to style the active marker.

#### Next / previous buttons

Many 'carousel' components offer next and previous buttons.
These could be declared explicitly in HTML,
or constructed as interactive pseudo-elements (e.g. `::next`/`::previous`).
The behavior of these could be defined in many ways:

- Defined by Javascript handlers.
  The amount to scroll can be calculated,
  rely on [css-scroll-snap-1 6.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-scroll-snap-1/#choosing) to choose the next snap point from a directional scroll (e.g. `scrollBy({left: 1})`),
  or use the proposed `scrollTo({left: 'snap-next'})` [explainer](https://github.com/argyleink/ScrollSnapExplainers/tree/main/js-scrollToOptions_Snap-Additions).
- Defined via page anchors (e.g. `<a href="#page2">`).
  This requires the author to create next / previous links for every page,
  which are only visible on that page,
  and to explicitly paginate their content independent of screen size.
- Implicit, by using new pseudo-elements or attributes (e.g. `<button type="next">`).

### Per-item markers & tabs

In more tab-like cases,
where a predictable number of markers are needed --
e.g. one marker per list-item --
they could be provided in markup.

This has several advantages,
since it gives authors more control,
and doesn't rely on interactive pseudo-elements.
However, it still comes with
it's own set of issues:

- Do we need a new element or attribute for assigning
  scroll-marker behavior?
  Or do authors have to do
  all the interaction/state-management manually?
- Is there a way for authors to keep the marker markup inline,
  and still 'hoist' the element into a parent grid context?

```html
<tabs>
  <section>
    <h2 marker>tab label</h2>
    <div class='panel'>tab panel</div>
  </section>
  …
</tabs>
```
