title: CSS Overflow Extensions

Managing content 'overflow' effectively on the web
requires a careful balance
of semantics, presentation,
and interactions.
While existing scroll/snapping
and disclosure widgets
provide a partial solution,
authors often have to cobble together
tabs, carousels, and accordions
from an incomplete set of tools.

Rather than developing a proposal
to handle one of these patterns,
I'm interested in what tools are needed
to make the existing patterns easier to build
effectively and accessibly.
