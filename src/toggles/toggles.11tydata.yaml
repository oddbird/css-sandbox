  I'm convinced this doesn't belong in CSS:

  - The style part of the problem --
    responding to state --
    is conditional CSS
    that can be handled with
    [container style queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-conditional-5/#style-container).
  - The issue of creating toggles
    should be addressed
    in other parts of the platform
    with features like
    [invoker commands](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Invoker_Commands_API).

  In retrospect,
  I'm afraid this exploration
  (driven by Chrome)
  acted as a distraction
  from more viable solutions --
  while requiring extra effort from accessibility experts
  to document all the issues with our approach.
