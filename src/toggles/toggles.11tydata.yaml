  I don't think this was a good proposal,
  or an idea that belongs in CSS:

  - The style part of the problem --
    responding to state --
    is better handled with features like
    [container style queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-conditional-5/#style-container).
  - The issue of creating toggles
    has been a real pain point,
    but is best addressed in other parts of the platform
    with features like
    [invoker commands](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Invoker_Commands_API).

  When Chrome asked me to explore
  a syntax for CSS toggles,
  I was one of many to raise concerns about accessibility --
  but didn't see harm in exploring the topic
  while they worked out the details.
  In retrospect,
  I'm afraid this acted as a distraction
  from better proposals --
  while requiring more effort from accessibility experts
  to document all the issues with our approach.
