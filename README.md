# Miriam's CSS Sandbox

This is a scratch site for
[Miriam Suzanne](https://oddbird.net/authors/miriam/)
to take notes & document ideas
related to the
[CSS Working Group](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/)
and CSS Specifications.

I like to work in the open,
and make my notes available --
you are welcome to explore,
and even [open issues or pull-requests][gh] --
but **this is my own personal notebook,
and not a replacement for CSSWG issue threads**.

## Development Scripts

This static site is built using
[Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/),
based on a [skeleton template](https://11ty.rocks/)
developed by [@5t3ph](https://twitter.com/5t3ph).

**`npm install`**

> Install everything needed to build/start the static site

**`npm start`**

> Run 11ty with hot reload at localhost:8080, including reload based on Sass changes

**`npm run build`**

> Production build includes minified, autoprefixed CSS
